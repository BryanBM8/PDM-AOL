This project was prepared in carrying out work on the AOL (Assurance of Learning) final project in the Program Design Methods course. This work was prepared with the approach of working on study case questions in the preparation of IPO Chart and Pseudocode. In addition, the work also comes in the form of a project to develop research on application requirements. To complete the project, we developed research on applications that accommodate contact with Binus internal parties such as LSC, SSC, lecturers and others so as to facilitate and smooth the bureaucratic process that occurs in teaching and learning activities.
